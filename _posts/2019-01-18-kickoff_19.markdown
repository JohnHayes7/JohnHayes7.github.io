Hey there!  Thanks for checking out my first blog post.

I'll admit this is a bit strange for me. I'm not a heavy user of social media, or posting about myself but here goes nothin...

I've spent my entire professional career as an Audio Engineer.  I've wanted to work in music since I was a kid and to be able to do that for over a decade has been pretty amazing.  It's been got to experience some things that were dreams come true.  Meet heroes.  And make some friends who will last a lifetime.

Over time, however,  I've felt the increased need for something new. And priorites, as they have a habit of doing, change.

When I started in music I was young, single and had minimal responsibilities.  Fast forward 15 year and I'm married to my amazing wife, and we have an incredble daughter. 

My urge for something new combined with this new set of priorities put me on the search to find a new career.

It seemed overwhelming at first, but I've really enjoyed the challenge of learning to code.  I find it has a lot of similarites with music.  You're constantly creating, putting together a puzzle, and problem solving all at the same time.  Challenging yourself to re-think your approach and perspective.

So that's where we are.  Starting off on this new adventure as I look to provide the best life possible for my amazing little family.

Cheers!
