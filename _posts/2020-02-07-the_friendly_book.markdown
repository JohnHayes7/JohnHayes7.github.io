First things first, I can not believe this is the final project and my time at Flatiron is coming to an end.  It's been an incredible, eye-opening, self-testing, challenging, journey. I knew absoultely nothing about coding when I started this and now I feel like I can kind of hold my own in this new world.  Thank you to everyone involved who helped along the way.

Ok, so onto the app...

The Friendly Book is an app intended to be used by fans of the band Phish.  Phish has a very dedicated fan base who live, eat and breathe this band.  The Friendly Book is a scrap-book, so to speak, for fans to share memories of shows and listen to shows they may have attended.  In the future I would like expand and tie in video footage for as many shows as possible.

Upon accessing The Friendly Book's landing page you'll be greated by some random Phish videos, which are accessed through the YouTube API.  You'll also find show information from a show on TIPH ("Today in Phish History"), if a show exists.  You'll get setlist info, and a link to listen to the show from Relisten.  This info is obtained from the Relisten API.  In fact, all show information found in The Friendly Book is obtained from Relisten.

The landing page also has a Login component which will allow you to login or link to the sign up page.  You can access all show information and see "memories" other people have left without creating an account or logging in.  However, you can not leave a memory, or access fan pages without logging in.  

Upon logging in you'll be redirected to your fan page where you can see your collection of "ticket stubs".  A ticket stub represents a show in your collection.  You're page will also display any memories you've left for your shows.  Once a show has been added to your collection you can add, edit or delete memories.

There will be future enhancements that will allow fans to upload photos, and that will tie in YouTube videos for as many shows as possible.

Building this app really put me to the test.  I suppose that is true for each of the portfolio projects, but this really stretched my planning skills and googling skills.  There were quite a few lessons learned along the way, mostly related to planning and mapping out how things should work.  However with those lessons I am a stronger and (hopefully) smarter developer.

I genuinely hope to continue this growth in my general development abilities/knowledge and with regards to this page.  I look forward to pushing myself and building an app that Phish fans will truly enjoy using.
