So this was quite an experience...

When going through the lessons, I felt fairly confident of my knowledge and "skills".  However, when faced with a blank canvas, everything seemed foreign and overwhelming.  After a small panic attack, I started taking small bites.  And, once I got through a small delay of finding a good site to scrape, things started taking form.

This momentum, was relatively short lived as I had some frustrations trying to figure out how these objects should relate.  Even though I had a general idea of how data should flow, I kept hitting walls and quickly losing perspective.

Additionally, my time was being dominated by an increasingly busy work schedule, a sick daughter, and then sick wife. Not being able to spend as much time as I should, made me feel like I was falling behind, which only added to my frustration and panic and round and round we went.

I'm pretty excited to have worked my way through it though.  I scaled back my initial plans, but think I kept my design open enough for future development.
