I'm writing this while kind of enjoying the "buzz" of finishing a project! 

For my Javascript/Rails API project I built a single page online store.  In this store you can search products by vendor or category and add items to your cart.  For timing sake I hard coded the customer profile and store profile, but given more time its coded and built to add multiple customer profiles and even multiple store profiles.

Its basically a very rudimentary Amazon, a "Shamazon" if you will.  

In the build up to the Sinatra and Rails projects, I was feeling pretty confident and felt I had a pretty good handle on the material and how a pretty good idea how to execute my ideas.  I got lost a little bit in the Javascript jungle during this one.  I wasn't too confident of my javascript abilities (and maybe that will show in the review). However, I have a whole new outlook after completing this.  This project, like ones before it, have really helped me get a handle on these concepts.  Building some from scratch really is a great way to test yourself.  

All in all the journey continues, picking up some more knowledge and developing some new skills along the way.  I'm looking forward to diving further into JS and sharpening these skills.

Cheers
