Coming from the music world, "Loops" meant something entirely different to me...or so I thought.

For years whenever I heard or thought "loop" it generally meant creating a section 4 beats or a multiple of 4 beats.  This would be the sample, then manipulate that sample and/or play it back as many times as you wanted.  You could LOOP your sample.  Pretty simple stuff.

When I first came across the concept of loops in coding, I thought it was cool tool. As I learned more about coding I began to realize the power of looping and iteration.  I also began to realize, its not that different from my musical understanding of looping.

Sure, there are some obvious differences. Code doesn't have time signatures, pitch or rhythm (though I would argue WRITING code certainly has a rhythm to it, but more on that another day).  Music doesn't have boolean values, or return values from your code.  You don't loop music to find something.  

However, in both coding and music you might loop a beat or loop through code UNTIL something happens.  Or WHILE something is happening.  Or FOR a certain amount of times Writing...

```
i = 0
until i > 10
puts #{i}
i +=1
end
```

Isn't all that different from saying "loop this beat UNTIL the chorus".  Or WHILE in the bridge loop this beat.  Both kinds of loops have some criteria that must be met to start the loop, the loop occurs, and then the loop ends.  Yes, this is a very simplistic way of looking at it but I've always thought it you can break something down to its most simplistic form then it will usually help you understand it, but give you confidence and belief that you understand it.

I don't know this makes sense to you, but it does inside my head.  

Loops are powerful, incredibly useful, and both simple yet potentially complex all at once.

If its getting too complex break it down...

This loop is going to happen FOR a particular amount of times, WHILE your criteria is true, or UNTIL your criteria is true.

Thanks!"
