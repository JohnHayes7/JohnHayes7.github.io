Just finishing up my Rails project.  The 3rd I've had to complete after my CLI and Sinatra projects.  I very much enjoyed working on those first two and this one was no different.  As much as I enjoy the labs and readme's, these projects really put your understanding to the test.  

Sometimes during the labs I have a difficult time visualizing the relationships between objects, so when building from scratch I find it crucial to be able to map out and have a visual representation of your models.  I'm sure there are more efficient methods, but before I did anything I literally sat down and drew out the relationships with pencil and paper.  I feel having some sort of physical connection and representation of what you want to do is incredibly beneificial.  When using software to map, I sometimes get lost and lose confidence in my work.  Its too easy for me to map something incorrectly, and when using pencil and paper I have to think more before each move and drawn line.

Anyway, I wanted to build some sort of League Management app where administrators and some others could use this app as a resource to view schedules, contact info, game results, make match assignments, track some basic stats and communicate game results.

My app got big pretty quickly, and before I knew it I had 10 different models. Almost all of which were related in some way. There were a few times I thought of scaling back, but I never really did.  Instead taking on challenges and troubleshooting for hours on end.  I'm glad I did though, each little victory felt good.

I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out.  Of course there are little tweaks and adjustments to make, but I'm pretty proud if this project.
